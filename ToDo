TO DO:
smooth Voxels (triquadratic interpolation)
collisions system
loading voxel models
multiple LOD levels (larger size chunks -> chunk-generation-area is one higher level chunk)
improve generation function
storing/loading scenes
different block types & textures
implement better fix to distance field artifacts
fix overwriting solid blocks distance values in sweep algorithm setup
highlight outline of targeted block
profiling for higher resolutions
check Windows compatibility

DONE:
chebyshev distance accelerated rendering
chebyshev distance field generation
overhaul chunk management (multiple chunk images rather than one)
descructible/buildable Terrain
cpu side chunks as host_local buffers
