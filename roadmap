TO DO:
smooth Voxels (triquadratic interpolation)
collisions system
chebyshev distance accelerated rendering
fov
loading voxel models
multiple LOD levels (larger size chunks -> chunk-generation-area is one higher level chunk)

DONE:
overhaul chunk management (multiple chunk images rather than one)
descructible/buildable Terrain
cpu side chunks as host_local buffers
